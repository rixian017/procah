                                <p>Police found Holden White at a residence in Lafayette, Louisiana, on Sunday morning (June 21). He was lying in a full bathtub with stab wounds to the neck and wrists. His family say he was physically tortured for hours
                                    before authorities arrived.</p>

                                <p>White was rushed to Lafayette General Medical Centre in critical condition, where he is still fighting for his life. His mother is now demanding justice for an attack that harmed her son “in ways that are unspeakable”.</p>

                                <p>“I just don’t understand what he could have done to someone so horrible to deserve to die,” she told local news station KATC.</p>

                                <p>She described her son as “good kid” and a proud member of the LGBT+ community. “He stands for the gay Pride thing, he’s won all sorts of trophies for acting, he’s a good kid, he doesn’t do drugs,” she said.</p>

                                <p>Police have arrested 19-year-old Chance Seneca in connection with the attack. He had reportedly been speaking with White on Grindr for about a week before they agreed to meet.</p>

                                <p>Seneca was at home when police arrived and was charged with attempted second-degree murder. He is being held at the Lafayette Parish Correctional Centre on a $250,000 bond.</p>

                                        <p>Trafficking in persons is an increasing problem that involves both sexual exploitation and labor exploitation of its victims. Trafficking affects all regions and the majority of countries in the world. Both men
                                            and women may be victims of trafficking, but the primary victims worldwide are women and girls, the majority of whom are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</p>

                                        <p>We take online identity verification seriously. We do the legwork so you feel confident that people are who they claim they are. We make sure to match up photos, identification cards and people’s names. We even
                                            provide codes so people can embed their verification site seal on their websites and other online profiles. In order to be valid, the code must be placed by the user: If someone else posts the code they get
                                            a warning the verification is not valid. This is one of the reasons we are gaining popularity. We not only verify people but we take extra steps to make sure no invalid person can use someone else's code.</p>
